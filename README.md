Advent of Code solutions in Python

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges,
implemented in Python.

The main goal of this repository is to strengthen my Python programming skills,
algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving abilities through practical exercises.
The solutions focus on clarity, correctness, and clean code structure rather than
maximum optimization.

## Technologies & Concepts
- Python 3
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Data processing
- Modular arithmetic
- Clean code practices
- Git & version control
